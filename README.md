The application is within the android folder, in the java section. Coded in java.

Description: 

Technology progresses at an ever increasing pace, and the innovations it brings along benefit all of us with great services and improvements to our daily lives. 
Well almost all of us. Many minorities, due to various reasons, are left out and don’t fully profit those improvements. 

SBB decided to tackle one of those issues, namely stations and trains accessibility for the visually impaired. 
They developed a new app aiming to provide all the necessary functionalities to easily book tickets and access the train to those unable to use the regular interface. 

One of the remaining challenges was to safely guide people to the train once they are on the platform.
We decided to address this challenge because we saw the real benefits and impact it could have on people. 
Moreover, in a time were certain uses of Machine Learning are being criticised for their questionable and sometimes unethical uses, we believed  it was a great opportunity to display a very positive and uplifting application of this technology

To actually implement this new functionality, we opted for an relatively classic approach, namely real-time object-detection of the train door and button. 
We then issued voiced instructions to guide as accurately as possible to the train doors. 

For now, due to a lack of train door in our work place, we mimicked doors with paintings, as we were more focused on the guiding aspect rather than the detection in itself.   

There is still huge room for improvement, for instance handling guidance whenever the platform is very crowded. 

As a final note, we’d like to thanks SBB for proposing such a challenge, we had much fun participating and creating our small demo.
